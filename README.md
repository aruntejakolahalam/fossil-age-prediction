# Fossil Age Prediction Using Regression Models

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the age of fossils using regression-based machine learning
models. The objective is to evaluate how different regularization techniques and regression
approaches impact model performance, interpretability, and prediction accuracy.

## Key Analysis Areas
- Data preprocessing and feature encoding
- Linear regression with L1, L2, and Elastic Net regularization
- Support Vector Regression with regularization
- Model performance evaluation using R² score
- Fossil age prediction using a saved model (.pkl)

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Regression and regularization techniques
- Model persistence using Joblib
