# Assumptions and Limitations

- Analysis is based on the provided fossil dataset without external data enrichment.
- Data preprocessing and feature encoding choices impact model outcomes.
- The dataset size is relatively small, limiting model generalization.
- Model performance reflects historical data only and not unseen fossil patterns.
- Interpretability is limited for non-linear models such as SVR with RBF kernels.
- Results assume consistent data quality and feature relevance across samples.
