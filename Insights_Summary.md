# Insights Summary

- Regularized linear regression models (L1, L2, Elastic Net) produced consistent and stable results.
- L1 regularization improved feature selection by reducing less relevant coefficients to zero.
- Support Vector Regression achieved higher predictive accuracy for this dataset.
- Model performance indicated that the underlying data followed largely linear patterns.
- Dataset size influenced model choice, with simpler models performing comparably to complex ones.
- Saving and reusing the trained model enabled efficient and repeatable predictions.
